Introducing a website application built with React.js, inspired by the Olive Garden website. It features both a client and admin side, made in a week during my journey at Hackiv8 Fullstack bootcamp progam.

Client Side:
Users can easily explore menus and get detailed information about each item.

Admin Side:
Administrators can manage users with registration and login, and have control over menus and categories. Add, delete, and edit functionalities make it convenient for seamless management.
